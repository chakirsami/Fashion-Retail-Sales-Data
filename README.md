# Fashion-Retail-Sales-Data
This project explores and visualizes sales data from a fashion retail store to uncover key insights such as top-selling items, monthly sales trends, and payment preferences. Using Python, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib, we analyze purchasing patterns and customer behavior to support data-driven retail strategies.
