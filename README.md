# Fashion-Retail-Sales-Data
This project explores and visualizes sales data from a fashion retail store to uncover key insights such as top-selling items, monthly sales trends, and payment preferences. Using Python, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib, we analyze purchasing patterns and customer behavior to support data-driven retail strategies.
## 📊 Project Overview

Using a dataset of retail sales transactions, we explore:
- Top-selling items by total purchase amount
- Monthly sales trends over time
- Monthly item distribution via heatmaps
- Payment method breakdowns
- Item performance grouped by payment method

The analysis is entirely done using `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`.
